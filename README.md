## Julia logo graphics

_This is not an "official" Julia project..._ ;)

![Julia logo](images/julia-logo-325-by-225.png)

This folder contains copies of the logos for the Julia programming language. They are just "tidied up" versions of the original logo by Stefan Karpinski, with whom remains all the copyrights and trademarks.

"Tidied up" here means:

- font glyphs converted to outlines
- stray and unwanted points removed
- translucent graphics removed and replaced with solid color
- transparent background (for PNG files)
- thick strokes converted to filled objects with no stroke width

###About the font###

The font used for the logo's original design is generally known as MN Latin. MN is Muthu Nedumaran, of [Murasu Systems](http://murasu.com). Muthu Nedumaran developed several Indic fonts which are currently bundled with Mac OS X: Bangla MN, Gurmukhi MN, Kannada MN, Khmer MN, Lao MN, Malayalam MN, Myanmar MN, Oriya MN, Sinhala MN, Tamil MN, and Telugu MN.
The Latin (ie Western/Roman) character designs for all these fonts use the same distinctive "serifless Times Roman" style.
