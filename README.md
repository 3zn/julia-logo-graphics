## Julia logo graphics

This folder contains copies of the logos for the Julia programming language. They are just "tidied up" versions of the original logo by Stefan Karpinski, to whom remains all the copyrights and trademarks.

"Tidied up" here means:

- fonts converted to outlines
- stray and unwanted points removed
- transparency removed (for PDF) and added (for other formats PNG)
- thick strokes converted to filled objects with no stroke width

This is not an "official" Julia project... ;)
