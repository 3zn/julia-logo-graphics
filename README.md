## Julia logo graphics

_This is not an "official" Julia project..._ ;)

This folder contains copies of the logos for the Julia programming language. They are just "tidied up" versions of the original logo by Stefan Karpinski, with whom remains all the copyrights and trademarks.

"Tidied up" here means:

- fonts converted to outlines
- stray and unwanted points removed
- translucent graphics removed and replaced with solid color
- transparent background (for PNG files)
- thick strokes converted to filled objects with no stroke width
